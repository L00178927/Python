# This Python script is written by Vinay Reddy B

#In Windows command prompt run the command 'pip install pylint' for this script

a = 178
b = 927
c = "Vinay"

print(a + b)

# Corrected the mistake of using capital 'B' here
print(a + b)

# Ensured concatenation of string and integer for 'a' and 'c'
print(str(a) + c)

###It performs addition between a and b, fixes the capital 'B' to lowercase, and converts integer 'a' to a string to concatenate with the string 'c'.
