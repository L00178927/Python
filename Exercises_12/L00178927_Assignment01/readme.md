# Project: l00178927Assignment01

## Introduction
In this section, we'll wrap up the theoretical concepts covered and kick off our initial project. This project aims to establish a standard directory structure, file naming conventions, and more.

## Directory Structure
The root directory for this project is named `Exercises_12`. It contains the following subdirectories:
- `source`: Stores packages/modules.
- `Tests`: Holds test-related files.
- `Examples`: Contains example files.
- `Documentation`: Keeps project documentation.

## Setup
Before starting, create a directory to store example files, such as `OneDrive\Python\Exercises_12`.

### Batch File
Create a batch file named `create.bat` to generate the necessary directories automatically.

### Main File
- Create a `main.py` file under the `Project` directory.

### `mypaths.py`
- In the root directory, create a file named `mypaths.py` to define the paths for essential files.

## Header Template
The project includes a header file named `header_template.py`. Use this file as a starting point for new code files.
